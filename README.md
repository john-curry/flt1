The first installment of the Funny Little Thing series. It was an attempt at a project in c++ as I had just learned it. It is a command line, turn based, rpg, where you create your team and then fight a battle. You control both your team and the enemies team. Some of class choices are broken so it mostly defaults your characters class choice to warrior.
